### 🧠 Skills Demonstrated (Power BI Focus)

During my training, I developed practical Business Intelligence skills using **Power BI Desktop**. This includes **data modelling** by creating relationships between multiple tables, building **DAX measures** for calculated fields and KPIs, and designing effective visuals such as **line charts, stacked bar charts, treemaps, and map visuals**. I also focused on **dashboard interactivity and consistent formatting** to create clear, user-friendly reports that support strong data storytelling.
